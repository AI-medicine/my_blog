    "\n",
    "With AI I refer to anything in AI. It was only some time later, that I realized that my chances to do something meaningful with medicine and AI without studying computer science for example, would be probably best with deep learning (which is a part of machine learning). \n",
    "\n",
    "I have no profound coding background. Three years ago, I participated in a first coding Python beginner course from my university. Afterwards I also peeked from time to time into AI topics, but I never really found a way to focus on it more. \n",

    "So a little later, as I was frustrated and was not really sure where to go, I started to just continue to learn Python. It was late 2019 that I continued with Python. I ordered a \"Crash Course\" Python book (it is better as one may think from the title). I would highly recommend this book to people who have no idea about coding and would also like to do something with deep learning or programming in general and don't know where to start. But of course I have no comparison and therefore I can only pass on what worked for me (until now).\n",

    "\n",
    "As I am also going to use the p-value at least partially soon in my own research, it was very helpful to hear from Jeremy several kind of \"take home messages\" regarding the p-value:\n",
    "\n",
    "- People very often make the mistake that they see a P-value which is not less than e.g. 0.05 and therefore make the erroneous conclusion that there is no relationship between data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- With very little data, it is almost impossible to reach a P-value less than 0.05 for any hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use the P-value to find out whether you have gathered enough data for your own project. If you cannot reject your null hypothesis, imagine your null hypothesis to be the opposite claim of your initial null hypothesis. If you can neither reject the one nor the other you simply need to collect more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One can neither measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true with P-values nor that the data were produced by random chance alone\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If a statistical model found by authors of a medical article suggests a practically relevant relationship between data, the practical importance should be inspected by looking at the slopes of the suggested function that describes the relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think about examples of independent variables and apply the respective slopes\n",
    "\n",
    "So I will quickly demonstrate this: Jeremy referred to an article in which there was putatively found a statistically significant relationship between transmissibility (dependent variable) and relative humidity and temperature (both independent variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Link: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551767\n",

    "R: transmissibility (of COVID-19)\n",

    "City 2: T 35 °C, H 80%\n",
    "\n",
    "If you now calculate the transmissibility for both cities, City 1 had R = 2.689. City 1 would have a massive Covid-19 pandemic, as one person would on average infect 2.7 persons.\n",
